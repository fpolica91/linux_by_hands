## Sudo

The `sudo` su command allows you to switch to the root user account (i.e., become the superuser) by entering the root password. When you run sudo su, you will be prompted for the root password, and if you enter it correctly, you will be logged in as the root user.

The `sudo su -`command is similar to sudo su, but it has some additional flags that modify the behavior of the command. The`-` flag tells su to run a login shell, which means that it will initialize a new environment for the root user. This includes setting up the root user's environment variables, working directory, and other settings as defined in the root user's login scripts `(e.g., /root/.bashrc)`.

One key difference between `sudo su` and `sudo su -` is that` sudo su -` will reset the environment variables to their default values, while sudo su will keep the current environment variables. This can be important if you need to ensure that the root user has a clean and predictable environment.

Another difference is that `sudo su -` will change the current working directory to the root user's home directory `(/root)`, while sudo su will keep the current working directory.

In general, `sudo su -` is more similar to logging in as the root user directly, while `sudo su` is more like running a single command as the root user.
