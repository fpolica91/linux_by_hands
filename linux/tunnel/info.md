### SSH Tunnel for Network Traffic

[...]
An SSH Tunnel, also known as an SSH Port Forward, is a way to create a secure connection between two networks over an insecure network, such as the Internet. It allows for the forwarding of network traffic over an SSH connection. This is useful for securely connecting to a remote network, or for securely accessing a service on a remote network that is not otherwise accessible.

An SSH Tunnel is created by forwarding a local port on the client machine to a remote port on the server machine. This is done by running an SSH client on the client machine, and connecting to the server machine. Once the connection is established, the client can then forward a local port to a remote port on the server machine. This creates a secure "tunnel" between the two networks, allowing network traffic to be sent over the SSH connection.

For example, if you want to access a web server on a remote network that is not accessible from the Internet, you can create an SSH Tunnel to forward traffic from your local machine to the remote web server. This allows you to access the remote web server as if it were on your local network, even though it is not directly accessible from the Internet.

Another common use case for SSH Tunneling is to securely access a database or other service that is running on a remote network. This can be done by forwarding traffic from a local port to the port on which the service is running on the remote network.

In summary, SSH Tunneling is a way to securely forward network traffic over an insecure network, by creating a secure connection between two networks over an SSH connection. It's very useful when you want to access a service or a network that is not directly accessible over the internet.

## SSH Tunneling Commands (Copy SSH Public Key to Remote Server)

The command `ssh-copy-id cloud_user@10.0.1.100` is used to install an SSH public key on a remote server. This is typically done to set up password-less authentication for SSH connections to the remote server.

The `ssh-copy-id` command copies the contents of the local machine's SSH public key file (usually located at `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)` to the remote server's authorized_keys file. This allows the local machine to connect to the remote server without the need to enter a password.

In this specific case, the command is being used to install the local machine's SSH public key on a remote server with the IP address of 10.0.1.100 and the username `cloud_user`. Once the command is executed, the local machine will be able to connect to the remote server without the need to enter a password, as long as the private key on the local machine matches the public key that was installed on the remote server.

It is important to note that this command assumes that you already have a ssh key pair on your local machine, if not you need to generate them with `ssh-keygen` command before running this command.

It is also important to consider that this command is a very powerful command and it should be used with caution, if in wrong hands or in wrong server it could give a malicious user access to your server without password.

## Create SSH Tunnel

The command `ssh -f cloud_user@10.0.1.100 -L 2000:10.0.1.100:80 -N` is used to create an SSH Tunnel.

The "-f" flag is used to run the SSH process in the background, allowing the user to continue working on their local machine without being logged into the remote machine.

The "-L" flag is used to specify the port forwarding. It forwards all traffic that comes to the local machine's port 2000, to the remote machine's port 80. This allows the user to access the remote machine's port 80 as if it were on the local machine's port 2000.

The `-N` flag is used to prevent SSH from executing a remote command, it is used when the main goal is to establish a tunnel, and not to execute a command on the remote machine.

In this specific case, the command is being used to create an SSH Tunnel to forward traffic from the local machine's port 2000 to the remote machine's port 80. The user `cloud_user` is connecting to the remote machine with the IP address of` 10.0.1.100.`

This command can be useful in situations where a user wants to access a service on a remote network that is not otherwise accessible, for example a web server that is running on a private network. By forwarding traffic from a local port to the port on which the service is running on the remote network, the user can access the service as if it were on their local network.

It is important to note that SSH Tunneling is a powerful technique, but it should be used with caution. It is recommended to use a firewall to restrict access to the forwarded port to only trusted IPs or networks.
